<h1>The Great Migration and Its Impact</h1>
<p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/heyyniss">Anissa Pierre</a></p>

<p>In 1949, 16-year-old Bertha left her small hometown of Mullins, South Carolina to follow her older sister to better economic opportunity in Brooklyn. Unbeknownst to her, she was part of “one of the largest and most rapid mass internal movements in history,” according to Nicholas Lemann in his book “The Promised Land: The Great Black Migration and How It Changed America.”</p>

<p>The Great Migration occurred between 1910 and 1970. During this time over 6 million African Americans moved from the south to urban centers in the northeast and west. The movement is thought of in two waves: the first from 1910 to 1940 and the second from 1940 through 1970. </p>
