<h1>How U.S. Policy Fueled Mexican Migration</h1>
<p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/heysetareh">Setareh Baig</a></p>

<p>
<span class="firstcharacter">W</span>hen Jesus Villalba was a child living in Puebla, Mexico, he knew about America. At his grandmother’s house, his family wanted American channels so much that his brother figured out a way to access them: with cutlery. He climbed the roof and attached a fork to a parabolic antenna. 
<br>
“We paid close attention to American television,” Jesus said. Meanwhile in town, women waited in line at the supermarket for a machine that grinds corn – one of Puebla’s main agricultural industries. Waiting in line, women would gossip about which of the town’s residents were going to America – who would come back to Mexico, and who left to America for good. Soon, the corn lines would get shorter, as Puebla residents would leave the state to the point of desolation and eventually, they would all go to America. 
<br>
Nearby Jesus’s home, a sugar cane production plant provided income and employment for much of his home state. According to Jesus, the plant would produce sugar cane once per year. In the 1990s production slowed, and the plant started to produce once every two years. Across industries, Mexican agricultural workers were quickly losing work. 
<br>
Suddenly, Jesus’s grandparents began to sell off their land, and soon after, their livestock, to make ends meet. “I don't know why they started doing it,” Jesus said. “They must have needed the money now.”
<br>
“The idea of adults leaving – that was just a thing that happened. Some uncle or aunt was going up north. I didn’t know what it meant.” 
<br>
Jesus’s family would leave and come back to Mexico with gifts. His father, the first one to leave when it became difficult to find work in Puebla, would come and go between America and Mexico. He grew up raised by his grandmother – like many of the other adults, his mother left to the U.S. early on in Jesus’s life. At a certain point, his father stopped coming back. 
<br>
He didn’t know it at the time, but as a child in Mexico, Jesus’s life was intimately linked to America. While Jesus spent his childhood basing his concept of America from television shows like Sabrina the Teenage Witch, U.S. corn and sugar crept into Mexican supermarkets. Soon, Mexico was flooded with American Products like Krispy Kreme doughnuts. 
<br>
Something American, larger than Jesus could understand, was brewing in Jesus’s homeland that would eventually take Jesus on a week-long pilgrimage to America, never to return again.  

<br>
<h2>When Puebla residents Crossed the U.S. Border</h2>
<br>
<p>If a Mexican farmer needs to sell his corn for ten dollars to make a profit, an American farmer needs to sell his corn for eight dollars. This is because the American farmer produces corn in mass quantities, saving her time and money. 
<br>
Like most Puebla residents, Jesus’s family worked on a small-scale corn and livestock farm, and needed a certain amount of money to make a profit. The Mexican government, or any government that wants to protect local farmers, would normally put a trade tariff on American imports to allow agricultural workers, like Jesus’s grandmother, to continue to make a profit. If American corn were to sit on the shelves of a supermarket in Mexico, it might be twelve dollars as opposed to the minimum eight Jesus’s grandmother needs to make a profit. A trade tariff prevents the American farmer from selling her corn cheaper in a Mexican supermarket. 
<br>
In Mexico, this makes it easier for local Mexican products to compete on the shelves with American imports. Without tariffs, lower-priced American corn would imperil the sales of higher-priced Mexican corn, halting Jesus’s grandmother’s revenue stream. Without tariffs, local farmers in every agricultural industry can’t compete with American products, and the Mexican economy suffers. </p>
<br>
<h3> A trade tariff prevents the American farmer from selling her corn cheaper in a Mexican supermarket. </h3>
<br>
<p>In 1994, Bill Clinton signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), with the intention to increase the flow of goods and break down trade barriers between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. “NAFTA means jobs,” Clinton said. NAFTA reduced tariffs on American imports to Mexico, or got rid of them altogether. 
<br>
“The way NAFTA impacted my family specifically was a chain reaction,” Jesus said. “At a certain point, people started leaving and then never coming back. They would just send money instead of coming back.”
<br>

In January of 1994, NAFTA was enacted in Mexico, which enabled the U.S. to compete with Mexico. NAFTA made it so that American products monopolized a lot of the a lot of the local markets that people relied on to live. 
<br>
Through NAFTA, some American products entered the Mexican market for the first time. Mexico was finally able to get their hands on the same Krispy Kreme products Americans enjoyed, so the deal was celebrated as a success, despite America and Canada reaping disproportionately more benefits. Flooded with American products muscling out sales of local products, the Mexican economy was left in ruins.
<br>
During the Great 2008 recession, Mexico’s economy was inextricably linked to the U.S. economy through NAFTA. Mexico suffered more than any country in Latin America. 
<br>
Thus began one of the largest waves of Mexican migrations the the United States. Jesus’s family was one of such families, after American products imperiled his family’s revenue stream. For a better education and economic opportunities, Jesus’s family left a desolate Puebla, one of the three poorest Mexican states. </p>
<br>

<h3>Thus began one of the largest waves of Mexican migrations to the the United States. </h3>
<br>

<p>When Jesus was 14-years old, he walked across the border with his step father to the United States because it was the norm. Everyone, Jesus said, was doing it. 
<br>
Americans were blind to Mexico’s invisible suffering at the hands of U.S. policy. Then thousands of Mexicans marched across the U.S. border. For the first time, they would see it.</p>
